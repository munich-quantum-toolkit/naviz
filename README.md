## Key Features

- Instant playback of the loaded input neutral atom quantum computation
- Export of the visualization as a video
- Scrubbable timeline to navigate through the visualization
- Fully customizable machine architecture specification
- Support for different input formats
- Fully customizable visualization style and clean predefined styles

## Getting Started

`mqt.naviz` is available via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mqt.naviz/) for all major operating systems and supports Python 3.9 to 3.13.

```console
(.venv) $ pip install mqt.naviz
```

The following code gives an example of the usage:

<!-- todo: Fill in example code below -->

```python3
from mqt.naviz import ???
```

**Detailed documentation and examples are available at [ReadTheDocs](https://mqt.readthedocs.io/projects/naviz).**

## System Requirements

Building (and running) is continuously tested under Linux, MacOS, and Windows using the [latest available system versions for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions/runner-images).
However, the implementation should be compatible with any current Rust compiler.

MQT NAViz relies on some external dependencies:

<!-- todo: Add deps as bullet points with links -->
